## Overview

**Bolt** is a **Zig-native container runtime** that redefines how services are built, shipped, and deployed.  
It unifies:  

- **Docker‚Äôs runtime simplicity**  
- **Compose‚Äôs orchestration model**  
- **Nix‚Äôs declarative reproducibility**  
- **Proxmox/LXC‚Äôs lightweight virtualization**  

**Surge** is the orchestration layer that powers Bolt.  
It replaces brittle YAML with **TOML Boltfiles**, providing a modern, readable, and deterministic way to define environments.  

Together, they deliver a **fast, secure, and declarative alternative** to Docker + Compose.  

---

## Why Bolt?

Containers today are fragmented:  
- Docker is runtime-focused but aging.  
- Kubernetes is powerful but bloated.  
- Nix provides reproducibility but not simple orchestration.  
- Proxmox offers lightweight virtualization, but not modern runtime portability.  

**Bolt unifies these ideas into one coherent stack**.  
It‚Äôs designed to be **developer-friendly**, **secure by default**, and **scalable across bare metal, cloud, and homelabs**.  

---

## Design Goals

- ‚ö° **Performance First**  
  Zig runtime with predictable memory and low overhead.  

- üß© **Declarative Configs**  
  TOML Boltfiles for clarity, reproducibility, and version control.  

- üîê **Security by Default**  
  Signed manifests, encrypted networking (`zcrypto`), rootless containers.  

- üåê **Protocol-Native Networking**  
  QUIC (`zquic`), DNS (`zdns`), and Auth (`zauth`) integrated from day one.  

- üì¶ **Capsules**  
  Bolt‚Äôs native, LXC-like container: lightweight, snapshot-ready, and resource-efficient.  

- üõ† **Unified Orchestration**  
  Surge integrates service orchestration directly into Bolt ‚Äî no external tooling required.  

---

## Configuration: Boltfile (TOML)

Bolt uses **TOML Boltfiles** for defining projects.  
This eliminates YAML indentation issues and provides strict typing.  

Example:

```toml
project = "demo"

[services.web]
image = "bolt://nginx:latest"
ports = ["80:80"]
volumes = ["./site:/usr/share/nginx/html"]

[services.api]
build = "./api"
env.DATABASE_URL = "bolt://db"

[services.db]
capsule = "postgres"

[services.db.storage]
size = "5Gi"

[services.db.auth]
user = "demo"
password = "secret"

Bring the stack online:
```bash
bolt surge up
```

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 ‚Äì Core Runtime
- [ ] OCI image support (pull, build, run)  
- [ ] Bolt **Capsules** (LXC-like isolation)  
- [ ] Rootless namespaces & cgroups integration  
- [ ] Snapshot/restore functionality  

### Phase 2 ‚Äì Surge Orchestration
- [ ] Boltfile (TOML) parser & schema validation  
- [ ] Multi-service orchestration (`bolt surge up`)  
- [ ] Networking & DNS via `zdns`  
- [ ] Persistent storage & volume support  
- [ ] Health checks & service dependencies  

### Phase 3 ‚Äì Advanced Platform
- [ ] Secure service auth with `zauth`  
- [ ] QUIC fabric (`zquic`) for distributed services  
- [ ] Declarative builds (Nix-like reproducibility)  
- [ ] Web UI (Proxmox-style for capsules & clusters)  
- [ ] Remote orchestration across multiple nodes

## Ecosystem Integration

Bolt is part of the **GhostStack protocol ecosystem**:  

- [`zcrypto`](https://github.com/ghostkellz/zcrypto) ‚Üí Cryptographic primitives  
- [`zquic`](https://github.com/ghostkellz/zquic) ‚Üí QUIC transport layer  
- [`zdns`](https://github.com/ghostkellz/zdns) ‚Üí DNS & service discovery  
- [`zauth`](https://github.com/ghostkellz/zauth) ‚Üí Authentication & SSO  
- [`zsync`](https://github.com/ghostkellz/zsync) ‚Üí Async runtime

## Vision

Bolt is not just a container runtime.  
It‚Äôs a **new foundation for reproducible, secure, and distributed systems**.  

By combining runtime, orchestration, declarative configs, and security into one stack, Bolt removes the need for Docker + Compose + Kubernetes + Nix + LXC as separate layers.  

Bolt is **the next step in container infrastructure**.
