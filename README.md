## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bolt.cktech.org | bash
```

---

## Quick Start

### Container Management
```bash
# Run containers with nvbind GPU runtime
bolt run --runtime nvbind --gpu all ubuntu:latest
bolt run --name web --ports 8080:80 nginx:latest

# List containers with modern output
bolt ps
bolt ps -a

# Container lifecycle
bolt restart web --timeout 30
bolt stop web
bolt rm web --force
```

### GPU & Gaming
```bash
# Configure nvbind GPU runtime
bolt gaming gpu nvbind --devices all --performance ultra --wsl2
bolt gaming gpu check
bolt gaming gpu list

# Launch gaming workloads
bolt gaming launch steam
bolt gaming wayland
```

### Snapshots
```bash
# Create snapshots
bolt snapshot create --name "before-update" --description "Before system update"
bolt snapshot list --verbose

# Rollback and cleanup
bolt snapshot rollback stable-config
bolt snapshot cleanup --dry-run
```

### Orchestration
```bash
# Multi-service orchestration
bolt surge up
bolt surge down
bolt surge status
bolt surge logs --follow
```

### Networking & Volumes
```bash
# Create QUIC networks
bolt network create gaming-net --driver bolt --subnet 172.20.0.0/16
bolt network ls

# Manage volumes
bolt volume create game-data --size 100GB
bolt volume ls
```

## Why Bolt?

Containers today are fragmented:  
- Docker is runtime-focused but aging.  
- Kubernetes is powerful but bloated.  
- Nix provides reproducibility but not simple orchestration.  
- Proxmox offers lightweight virtualization, but not modern runtime portability.  

**Bolt unifies these ideas into one coherent stack**.  
It’s designed to be **developer-friendly**, **secure by default**, and **scalable across bare metal, cloud, and homelabs**.  

---

## Design Goals

- ⚡ **Performance First**
  Rust runtime with zero-cost abstractions, memory safety, and low overhead.  

- 🧩 **Declarative Configs**  
  TOML Boltfiles for clarity, reproducibility, and version control.  

- 🔐 **Security by Default**
  Signed manifests, encrypted networking, rootless containers, and Rust's memory safety.

- 🌐 **Protocol-Native Networking**
  QUIC networking, DNS resolution, and authentication integrated from day one.  

- 📦 **Capsules**  
  Bolt’s native, LXC-like container: lightweight, snapshot-ready, and resource-efficient.  

- 🛠 **Unified Orchestration**  
  Surge integrates service orchestration directly into Bolt — no external tooling required.

## Configuration: Boltfile (TOML)

Bolt uses **TOML Boltfiles** for comprehensive project configuration including services, snapshots, networking, and GPU settings.

### Gaming & GPU Configuration
```toml
project = "gaming-setup"

# Gaming service with nvbind GPU runtime
[services.steam]
image = "ghcr.io/games-on-whales/steam:latest"
ports = ["8080:8080"]

[services.steam.gaming.gpu]
runtime = "nvbind"                    # 100x faster GPU passthrough
isolation_level = "exclusive"         # Dedicated GPU access
memory_limit = "8GB"

[services.steam.gaming.gpu.nvbind]
driver = "auto"                       # Auto-detect driver

```

### Snapshot Configuration
```toml
[snapshots]

[snapshots.retention]
keep_daily = 7                        # Keep 7 daily snapshots
keep_weekly = 4                       # Keep 4 weekly snapshots
keep_monthly = 6                      # Keep 6 monthly snapshots
max_total = 50                        # Maximum total snapshots

[snapshots.triggers]
daily = "02:00"                       # Daily at 2 AM
before_build = true                   # Before image builds
before_surge_up = true                # Before surge operations
min_change_threshold = "100MB"        # Only if >100MB changed

[[snapshots.named_snapshots]]
name = "stable-config"
description = "Known working configuration"
keep_forever = true
```

### Network Configuration
```toml
[networks.gaming-net]
driver = "bolt"                       # QUIC networking
subnet = "172.20.0.0/16"
gateway = "172.20.0.1"
```

Launch your stack:
```bash
bolt surge up
```

## Requirements

- **Rust 1.85+** (Required for latest async/await optimizations and performance improvements)
- **Linux Kernel 5.4+** (For container namespaces and cgroups v2 support)
- **Tokio 1.0+** (Async runtime integration)

---

## 🚀 Rust API Integration

Bolt provides a **production-ready Rust API** for programmatic container management:

### **Quick Start**

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
bolt = { git = "https://github.com/CK-Technology/bolt" }
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
```

### **Basic Usage**
```rust
use bolt::api::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> bolt::Result<()> {
    let runtime = BoltRuntime::new()?;

    // Run containers
    runtime.run_container("nginx:latest", Some("web"), &["8080:80"], &[], &[], false).await?;

    // Gaming containers with GPU
    let gaming_config = GamingConfig {
        gpu: Some(GpuConfig { nvidia: Some(NvidiaConfig { dlss: Some(true), .. }), .. }),
        wine: Some(WineConfig { proton: Some("8.0"), .. }),
        ..
    };

    runtime.add_gaming_service("steam", "bolt://steam:latest", gaming_config);
    runtime.surge_up(&[], false, false).await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

### **Integration Examples**

**🎮 Ghostforge (Gaming Container Management):**
```rust
// Create gaming-optimized containers with GPU passthrough
let runtime = BoltRuntime::new()?;
runtime.setup_gaming(Some("8.0"), Some("win10")).await?;
runtime.launch_game("steam://run/123456", &[]).await?;
```

**🖥️ nvcontrol (GPU Management):**
```rust
// Allocate GPU resources to Bolt containers
runtime.create_network("gpu-net", "bolt", Some("10.2.0.0/16")).await?;
runtime.run_container("bolt://gpu-workload", None, &[], &[], &[], false).await?;
```

**📦 Programmatic Boltfiles:**
```rust
let boltfile = BoltFileBuilder::new("my-project")
    .add_gaming_service("game", "bolt://steam:latest", gaming_config)
    .build();

config.save_boltfile(&boltfile)?;
```

### **Feature Flags**
```toml
bolt = { git = "https://github.com/CK-Technology/bolt", features = ["gaming", "quic-networking"] }
```

- `gaming` - Gaming optimizations, GPU support, Wine/Proton
- `quic-networking` - Ultra-low latency QUIC networking
- `oci-runtime` - Full OCI container support
- `nvidia-support` - NVIDIA GPU passthrough
- `amd-support` - AMD GPU support

---

## Ecosystem Integration

Bolt integrates with modern Rust ecosystem libraries for enhanced functionality:

- **Cryptography** → Secure networking and container signing
- **QUIC Networking** → Ultra-low latency transport
- **DNS Resolution** → Service discovery and networking
- **Authentication** → Secure service-to-service communication
- **Async Runtime** → Powered by Tokio for high-performance I/O

---

## Vision

Bolt is not just a container runtime.  
It’s a **new foundation for reproducible, secure, and distributed systems**.  

By combining runtime, orchestration, declarative configs, and security into one cohesive Rust-powered stack, Bolt removes the need for Docker + Compose + Kubernetes + Nix + LXC as separate layers.  

Bolt is **the next step in container infrastructure**.
