Description: Next-generation Rust container runtime with gaming optimizations
 Bolt is a modern container runtime written in Rust that provides:
 .
  * Gaming optimizations with GPU passthrough support
  * QUIC networking for faster container communication
  * Native Wayland support for GUI applications
  * OCI compatibility for existing container workflows
  * Memory safety and performance through Rust
 .
 Designed for both traditional server workloads and gaming/desktop
 applications requiring hardware acceleration and low-latency networking.
