  - Wayland-native gaming containers
  - Ultra-low latency networking for esports
  - Specialized GPU memory management
  - Game-specific filesystem optimizations
  - Inspiration from podman too! and make it work with rootless containers 
  - Open source pllatform 
  - Work wonderfully with wine/proton and lutris.
  - Compatibility with our rust project - Ghostforge a lutris alternative
  - exceptional nvidia gpu vfio/passthrough support with native performance implementations 
  - Support for nvidia gpu's latest features like DLSS, Raytracing, and CUDA
  - What if we supported the ability to really streamline gaming on linux? 
  - Framework for building game containers 
  - Want it to run near native performance. 
  - WAY better networking fuctionality than docker networking 
  - We'll be competing directly with docker, podman, lxc, and nixOS 
  - native wayland xwayland experience
